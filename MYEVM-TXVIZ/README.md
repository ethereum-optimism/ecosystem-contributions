Hello, OP community. I as invited through my Zeropointlabs github account, but this github account is better suited for this project.


# Project Title: My EVM - A Multiplayer 3D World & Optimism Blockchain Explorer

## Introduction
"My EVM" is an innovative multiplayer 3D world that serves as an Optimism blockchain explorer, offering first-person, third-person, and isometric views. Developed with Unity and WebGL, it provides an immersive experience in blockchain exploration. The project gamifies on-chain labeling and enables user-generated world customization through the Leonardo AI API, aiming to make blockchain data accessible and engaging for users of all experience levels.


## Background
The complexity and inaccessibility of blockchain data have long been barriers to entry for individuals interested in the crypto space. Traditional blockchain explorers offer valuable information but often in formats that are not intuitive for all users, especially those without technical backgrounds. "My EVM" seeks to revolutionize this by transforming blockchain exploration into an immersive 3D experience, akin to navigating a virtual world. This approach not only makes blockchain data more accessible but also enhances users' understanding through interactive learning and gamification. Inspired by the success of interactive educational platforms in other domains, "My EVM" proposes a novel method to demystify blockchain technology for a global audience.

MyEVM.xyz and MyEVM.Casa (Coming Soon)

## Impact
"My EVM" merges gaming elements with data exploration, making on-chain activities accessible and engaging for a broader audience.


## Technical Details
"My EVM" leverages Unity for its robust 3D game development capabilities, enabling us to create immersive environments and characters. WebGL is utilized to ensure accessibility, allowing users to explore "My EVM" directly from their web browsers without the need for additional software. The Leonardo AI API plays a crucial role in user-generated content, enabling personalized world customization and dynamic storytelling based on user interactions. To address scalability, we're exploring decentralized hosting solutions like Akash Network, alongside traditional cloud services, ensuring "My EVM" can grow without compromising user experience. Detailed attention is given to optimizing network traffic and resource management to support a large user base and complex on-chain interactions.


## Challenges
- **Scalability**: Discusses scaling a 3D environment with server or serverless systems (considerations include Akash Network, Autonolas, and novel in-house decentralized Kubernetes hosting system).

## Revenue Streams for Sustainability
- **Land-Based NFTs**: Generate a UBI-like fees on a user-by-user basis by forever locked dex liquidity.
- **Subscription Services**: Include transaction scheduling, offer bonding, liquidity mining rewards, and P2P payments for on- or off-chain data.
- **In-World Economy**: Enable a marketplace for virtual goods and assets.
- **Complex Transaction Script Marketplace**: Access to the brightest minds in blockchain.
- **User and Job Placement Testing/Discovery**: Identify talented individuals through gameplay.
- **Educational Partnerships**: Collaborate with educational institutions for sponsored content.
- **Advertising and Sponsorships**: Integrate relevant advertising within the 3D world.
- **Grants and Funding**: Seek support from blockchain foundations and innovation funds.
- **Social Hub**: Offer programs that pay for college through gameplay or other novel programs.

## Experimental Paths to Explore
- **AI-Driven Storytelling**: Leverage AI for interactive stories of historical transactions or situations.
- **Transaction Debugging and Simulation**: Facilitate informed decisions visually.
- **Gamified contract Development**: Like Eth-Build Mixed with command and conquer.
- **Virtual Economy**: Develop a blockchain asset integrated economy.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Experiment with community voting on project decisions, contract labeling, default settings, and integration.
- **Cross-Chain Exploration**: Explore multiple blockchains within the 3D world.
- **Mini-Games**: Include cross-chain arbitrage matching like candy crush and bot running for income generation.
- **VR Integration**: Explore VR integration for a more immersive experience.
- **React Native Development or MetaMask Snaps**: Facilitate access to millions of users with simple app downloads.
- **Ready Player Me integration**: Simple Ready player me avatars or user generated avatars. I believe Nouns or Optimism Avatars are an obvious route.

## Inspirations
Inspired by Eth.Build, PHI, Tenerdly Debugger, Abi Ninja, and thirdweb, "My EVM" aims to visualize smart contract interactions and blockchain exploration innovatively. More recently this algo visualiztion when switched to 1st person perspective. https://dhruvmisra.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer-ThreeJS/


## User Interaction
"My EVM" is designed to engage users in a variety of interactive experiences that not only entertain but also educate. Hereâ€™s how:
- **Marketplace & Economy**: Users can trade virtual goods, contributing to a vibrant in-game economy. This mirrors real-world blockchain transactions and teaches users about market dynamics and smart contract execution.
- **Quests & Edutainment**: Structured quests guide users through learning modules about blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts, and the Optimism network, rewarding users for completing educational milestones.
- **Collectible Strategies and Environments**: Encourages users to explore different blockchain strategies and collect unique virtual items that represent blockchain concepts, fostering a deeper understanding of how blockchain technology can be applied in various contexts.
- **Multiplayer Conversations and Development**: Facilitates real-time discussions and collaborative problem-solving sessions, simulating a hackathon environment where users can co-create and learn from each other.
- **Hiring and Talent Discovery**: Incorporates mechanisms for talent discovery and job placement, allowing users to demonstrate their skills in real-time challenges, connecting talented individuals with potential employers within the blockchain ecosystem.

## Prototyping and MVP
The initial phase of "My EVM" focuses on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes:
- Basic 3D navigation of the Optimism blockchain landscape.
- A simple user interface for exploring transactions and blocks in real-time.
- Early gamification elements, such as on-chain labeling challenges.

We plan to release this MVP for community feedback, using insights gained to refine the experience. The goal is to quickly iterate based on user interaction data, enhancing features, and expanding educational content to cover more complex blockchain topics. This agile development process ensures "My EVM" remains responsive to community needs and educational goals.


## Call to Action

Since 2015, I have been thinking about what it would really take to solve crypto's last-mile problem. This platform aims to be free and open for everyone. Additionally, provide perks for those who believe in the power of this technology or at least who are willing to explore. 

We invite Unity developers, artists, storytellers, blockchain enthusiasts, educators, and AI experts to collaborate on "My EVM," contributing through funding, passion, or skill towards empowering individuals through permissionless systems. Timing is interesting as I am also submitting this to Nouns Prop House as their request for a Farcaster Client. One or both pulling through could bootstrap the project instantly.

While this seems ambitious, I beleive we have a lot to work with from the open source legends around us and even more value to add working as a hive mind towards a common goal. A core team of Myself, a front end developer, solidity developer, and unity developer could have a working prototype with minimal funding very quickly. I understand that we are currently exploring the concept at the idea stage, but much thought has gone into every aspect and I am very much open to hearing from others!

I believe this is well suited for the mad scientist catogory through the Optimism foundation and the simple integrations of farcaster, block exploration, and unity could create a simple hackathon proof of concept quickly.

Attached are examples of thoughts over the years as inspiration, but the first example image is a basic ui sketch showing the idea proposed here today.
