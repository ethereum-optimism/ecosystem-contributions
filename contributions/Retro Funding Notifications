# Title
Retro Funding notifications - Farcaster
## Summary
Build Farcaster tooling so that builders can receive notifications about upcoming Retro Funding rounds which are relevant to them


## Possible Features
"1. Implement a Farcaster frame to receive notifications about a Retro Funding round. Below is a possible user flow
1.1 Pick a Retro Funding round that you're interested in 
1.2. Confirm that you like to receive notifications about the Retro Funding round
2. Implement a bot which posts updated/notifications about rounds and tags the Farcaster users who signed up. (e.g. ""7 more days to sign up for Retro Funding: Onchain Builders, sign-up now!! @FarcasterUser1 @FarcasterUser2..."")
3. (nice to have) Post highlights of Farcaster users who have signed up for the round"
