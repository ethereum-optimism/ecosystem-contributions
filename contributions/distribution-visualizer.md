description: 'Visualising the actions of the DAO is a critical requirement for the system to trive once decentralised. A visualisor that makes it easy to see where grants are going and what the teams are doing with the grants (at least on chain) will allow for better tracking as well as easier flagging of potential corruption.'

A visualiser for grant distributions, and where the grants go once they have been distributed!

- able to expand each grant to see how the tokens where used
- bonus feature of highlighting any tokens that go from a grant recipient to a delegate (especially if that delegate voted for the grant).
