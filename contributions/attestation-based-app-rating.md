# Title

## Summary

The [AttestationStation](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/identity/overview) is a simple and unified way to make attestations on OP Mainnet, OP Goerli, or any other OP Stack-based chain.

You can use the AttestationStation to create an application that acts like Yelp for Dapps. Users should be able to give reviews to the Dapps that they've interacted and should be able to see the reviews that other users have provided. Some sort of filtering algorithm that's plugged into other attestation-based reputation systems could help filter out spam reviews.

## Possible Features

- Allow anyone to register a project for review.
- Allow users to leave reviews on projects.
- Allow users to see the reviews that others have left on a project.
- Allow users to search through projects.
- Allow everyone to see all reviews from a reviewer. 
- Bonus feature: Some kind of "accuracy rating" based on how many other reviewers rated the project the same as you (bonus bonus points for weighting based on how sure we are an address is real, based on other attestations). 

## Why this is cool

- Users would be safer when interacting with suspicious applications
- Users could see if other users are having similar problems with an app
- Developers could get feedback on how to improve apps
- OP Mainnet apps would become better as a result
