title: "Push-notifications to Notify Tokenholders about Inactive Delegates"
description: "Currently, only approximately 87m OP tokens are in votable supply (either self-delegated or to someone else), out of about 1.3 OP tokens in circulating supply. This poses security risks for our system as it increases the ability of a malicious actor to influence voting outcomes. In addition to merely increasing the number of tokens in votable supply, ultimately we want these delegated tokens to be delegated to thoughtful, informed, values-aligned, and representative delegates in order to achieve capture resistance. 

I'm looking for a rockstar team of builders to address these problems through the following idea: 

Directly contact tokenholders with push-notifications (e.g., messaging wallets through XMTP or DMs/ frames on Farcaster) to inform them whether their delegate has been an active voter on prior proposals. The individuals being contacted will then be given the opportunity to re-delegate their tokens to a different delegate (e.g., through a link to the delegation dashboard or directly in a Farcaster frame). 

This approach also presents the option to experiment by only notifying a random sample (treatment group) of tokenholders and comparing rates of re-delegation to the non-sampled tokenholders (control group). This is especially useful for learning what types of information and push-notifications help us reach our goals of improved delegation."

# Push-notifications to Notify Tokenholders about Inactive Delegates

## Summary

Notify tokenholders about whether or not their delegate has been voting in past rounds and give them the option to re-delegate based on that information.

## Possible Features

- Ability to directly contact OP tokenholders
- Ability to trace to whom this tokenholder has delegated tokens
- Ability to allow tokenholders to re-delegate if wanted
- Ability to track whether said tokenholder re-delegated

## Why this is cool

This idea addresses some of the most widespread problems we face in governance -- directly contacting voters, increasing governance participation, and increasing quality of governance participation!!

Besides the implementation which will be revolutionary in its own right and improve some core problems, we can systematically study the effects of these push-notifications on rates of re-delegation via an experiment, which can lead to a thoughtful public-facing write-up which we can share with the broader community and academic collaborators.
