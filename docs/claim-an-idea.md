To claim an idea you will need to complete the following tasks:

* [ ] Create a PR. Copy paste this todo list into the description.
* [ ] Create a discussion thread:
    * Inside this repo in [Discussions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/discussions/categories/builds)
    * In the [Optimism Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism) > Builder District > [Builder Ideas](https://discord.gg/vejYbHWU). 
        * Note you will need to get the developer role in Discord to see the Builder District. 
* [ ] Fill in the contributor info:

        ``` md

        links: [""]
        execution-status: ""
        ```
    * [ ] Add the team working on it. The format is `"@handle (Platform) @ team"`. 
        For example: `["@tezter (GitHub) @ DeFo", "@jack (Twitter)"]`
    * [ ] Add the link to your discussion in GitHub/Discord. You can _**ONLY HAVE ONE LINK for your discussion.**_
    * [ ] (OPTIONAL) Add links to your repository, the website for the build, or other relevant links for your build. 
    * [ ] Add your execution status:
