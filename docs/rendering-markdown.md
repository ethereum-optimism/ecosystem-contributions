# Rendering Markdown
There are 3 important directory path that are important to render the markdown properly:

1. **Ideas Markdown Folder** located under `/contributions`
2. **Ideas Structure** located under `/public/static/filter/filter.json`
3. **Overview Section*** rendered from `README.md` of the repository.

### Adding New Ideas
By putting new markdown into `/contributions` folder, each markdown will be rendered under project section on the site. The name of the file will be use as the route name for that particular page. Note that adding ideas is currently not open to the public. See [adding a request](./add-a-request.md) for more info. 

### Changing Ideas Structure
The most of the structure of each project can be dynamically change, such as adding/removing labels, change description. The content in `filter.json` will be use as a dynamic options for filtering all the ideas.

Although most of the content in `filter.json` can be adjusted. we recommend to change only the value of primary key. Just try not to change the main key of the filter.

### Chaining The Content of Overview Section
The overview section of the site is rendered from `README.md` of the repository.
